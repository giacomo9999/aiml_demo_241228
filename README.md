This is an extremely simple Python program that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that an individual from a particular population will have diabetes.  The actual code is pretty much cut-and-pasted from here:

And the data in the diabetes.csv file is from here:

Note that you will need to install the "pandas" and "sklearn" (or maybe "scikit-learn"-the name seems to have been changed) for the app to run successfully.
